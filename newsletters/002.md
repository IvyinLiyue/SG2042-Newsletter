# SG2042 Newsletter (2023-08-04 #002)

## Editor's Note

## Highlights

+ The openEuler RISC-V SIG has connected the SG2042 (EVB) server board to the OERV OBS (Open Build Service) for system build testing since April 2023, and it has been basically running stably for many months, and has provided a 6-30 times build acceleration for various large package builds. With the release of Milk-V Pioneer, more and more high-performance RISC-V devices based on SG2042 will join the OERV build farm, aiming to provide RISC-V package build acceleration for various systems including openEuler, Debian, Deepin, and so on.
